## Hey there! :wave:

I am Duygu and I am a UX Copywriter who is training to be a Web Developer. 
I have a background in Translation and Communications and have worked in these fields extensively. 
My career path steered me towards UX copywriting and then to web design. 
I started to design websites and I quickly realised I wanted to do more than design a website. I am currently following extensive training to become a web developer.
